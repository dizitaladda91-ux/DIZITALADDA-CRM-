/**
 * =====================================================
 * BUG FIX (see audit notes):
 * All "/bulk/*" routes (and "DELETE /bulk") were
 * previously registered AFTER their singular "/:id/..."
 * counterparts. Express matches by registration order,
 * and ":id" happily binds to the literal string "bulk" -
 * so PATCH /bulk/complete matched "/:id/complete" first
 * (id="bulk"), and same for /bulk/restore and DELETE
 * /bulk. Three of the four bulk operations were
 * effectively dead code in production. Fixed by moving
 * every "/bulk/*" route above any "/:id" route, matching
 * the "static routes before /:id" pattern already used
 * correctly for "/statistics" and "/timeline/:leadId" in
 * this same file - that pattern just needed to be
 * extended to cover two-segment paths too, not only
 * single-segment ones.
 * =====================================================
